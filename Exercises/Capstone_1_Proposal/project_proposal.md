## Get Started

|            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Fill in |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.                                                                                                                                 | This project will most likely use all the of the following technologies: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Jinja, RESTful APIs (using AXIOS or python requests), JavaScript, HTML, and, CSS. Other things that may be used include: blueprints (better to organize app), WTForms, bcrypt (for safely storing passwords), and Flask-Admin (for managing users) |
| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | It will be a mobile app, but ideally, it will also be formatted for websites (for computers).        |
| Goal       | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | This project is a triage app that anyone can use that is much more reliable than a google search and backed by studies. Additionally, the results of the patient-interviews can be sent to their doctors. The doctor gets the results of the interview and will make the appropriate decision. This app streamlines the patient assessment process.        |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Everyone is a potential user. If you are experiencing any kind of symptoms that are concenrning to you, you could use the app to give you an idea of what to do (ie. see a doctor if it's likely a medical condition). Also, doctors can have accounts so that they can receive patient interview results and make decisions on that (diagnosis, further tests, referral, etc.). This application is not a substitute for healthcare, but a useful tool that streamlines the process. It is important to ensure that healthcare professionals are verrified as well, because anyone can pretend to be a doctor and receive patient information (this is ideal, but that needs some research).        |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API.                                                                                                                                    | The API I would like to use is called [Infermedica](https://developer.infermedica.com/documentation/), which is a triage app. It allows you to start an interview that contains patient information, namely: age, sex, and symptoms/risk-factors. The result of the submitted interview will be: (1) possible medical conditions ordered from most to least likely, (2) a follow-up question to narrow down possible causes, and (3) a boolean that suggests if the interview should end if sufficient info is provided. Also, each condition contains a description, and reasons why it is a likely choice. The database for my application (for now I'll refer to it as Cyber-Clinic) will have the following tables: patients, doctors, admins, interviews, symptoms, medical_conditions, and recommendations. Since postgreSQL will be used, the following relationship tables will be used: patient-doctor, interview-symptoms, interview-medical_conditions, and interview-recommendations. Note: The admin is used for authenticating doctors. An admin can be someone at an institution (ie. hospital, clinic, pharmacy) or someone incharge of verrification for Cyber-Clinic. When a doctor signs up, they can't access their profile or patients until they are verrified. The doctor info will be sent to the admin, who will verify if that doctor is part of taht institution and signed up to the application. Institution admins can only be added by the Cyber-Clinic admin upon request and verification. It is important to note that, patients can still use the app without linking it to a specific doctor, but they may email the results to the doctor of their choice if they have the doctor's email.                                                                                                                                  |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/1) |
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/2) |
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/3) |
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/4) |
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/5) |
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/6) |

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |
