                    <h2>Bears</h2>
                    <p>While there are no grizzly bears in Ontario, there are polar bears (Ursus maritimus) on the James Bay coasts. In fact, these polar bears are the southernmost population in the wild. For polar bears that are easier to see, the Polar Bear Habitat research facility offers glimpses of bears on a landscape similar to these James Bay bears.</p>
                    <p>Black bears (Ursus americanus) are widespread throughout the province. Bears probably cross the mind of every camper at least once. Black bears are large forest-dwelling omnivores that are found across Ontario and are an essential part of a healthy ecosystem. They are usually black in colour, but some regional variations can give them a reddish-brown “cinnamon” appearance. Males are much larger and can weigh up to 400 kg, while females only weigh up to 230 kg. </p>

                    <h2>Otters</h2>
                    <p>The northern river otter (Lontra Canadensis) is the only otter in Ontario. They have brown, water-repellent fur that keeps them warm in cold waters and can measure up to 1.4 m in length and weigh up to 14 kg (30 lb)! Their streamlined bodies with a long tapered tail make them excellent swimmers. Otters use their long whiskers (called vibrissae) to help them find their aquatic prey items such as fish, crabs, turtles, clams and insects. And after every meal, river otters wash themselves to maintain their beautiful fur. </p>

                    <h2>Lynx</h2>
                    <p>Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) are widespread across the north woods, but seeing them is another story. </p>
                    <p>These big cats are masters of stealth, moving silently as they hunt. With their superior hearing, they tend to slip into the thickets well before humans spot them. Lynx are the second-largest cats in North America after the cougar. They live across the boreal forest, occurring sparsely throughout the province, generally north of Algonquin Provincial Park. </p>

                    <h2>Wolves</h2>
                    <p>The wolf is another icon of the wild. As top predators they serve an essential role in keeping the ecosystem in check. They primarily prey on beaver, moose, deer or caribou, depending on where they are and what’s available. </p>
                    <p>Ontario’s wolves range from Algonquin Provincial Park and throughout the north, but they are not all alike. The boreal forest is grey wolf country. These are North America’s most widespread wolves, occupying much of Northern Canada and the upper United States. Grey wolves are highly social animals who hunt in packs, but recent work with GPS collars has found some solitary wolves to wander incredible distances. One collared wolf from Michigan was recorded making a meandering 6,700-km journey from the Upper Peninsula all the way to the Ontario/Manitoba border! Grey wolves are some of the biggest wolves, weighing up to 65 kg (145 lb). They’re somewhat reminiscent of a German shepherd with their long, muscular bodies and shaggy fur, and are seen in a range of colours, including blond, brown and jet black. </p>

                    <h2>caribou</h2>
                    <p>Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are emblematic of the boreal forest and wilderness. These forest-dwelling ungulates (hoofed-toed mammals) once lived as far south as North Bay. They are related to moose and white-tailed deer, but unlike them, both sexes of caribou grow antlers. Males have massive ones, which are used for attracting mates during their breeding season. They drop these shortly after. Female caribou grow smaller antlers, which stay on throughout their pregnancy, an adaptation that is thought to give them protection against predators. </p>
